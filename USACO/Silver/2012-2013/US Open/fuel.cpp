/*
First observe that we want to go to a cheaper gas station rather than an expensive one
This means that if we are currently at gas station x, and there is a cheaper gas station y further down the road
If we have enough gas to go to y, then we skip x
If we donâ€™t have enough gas to go to y, then we buy just enough fuel at x to go to y
However, notice that if distance between y - x is greater than G, then we will not have enough fuel to go to the next cheapest gas station
In this case, we just fill the entire tank at x since there are no cheap gas stations that are within G units of distance
